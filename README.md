# Sharygin's group of triangles

Triangles with an isosceles "intriangle" or "extriangle" have a beautiful geometry and are parameterised by an elliptic curve.

I wrote about this in some detail [here](http://olivernash.org/2016/12/18/sharygins-group-of-triangles/index.html) and created this associated toy React app for a bit of fun.
